Devil's Eye is watching..!!

## All about the devil's vision
- Before students used to attend classes physically attending the classes and lecturers used to manually teach them while keeping an eye on them. But, due to the era of new normal we are here using the advantage of the internet and attending classes through Zoom video conferencing. Where a student needs to join the class through a link and have to keep their Camera and microphone on during the class. 
- But students will be students whatever the era it might be. Therefore, during the zoom sessions the student will switch off their camera and microphone and that is the new normal type of bunking the classes. Having said that, the mentor will be unaware of the status of the student. Finding if the student is attending the class or not is a tough task to do.
-Therefore, to overcome this problem we are developing an application called “DEVIL’S EYE”, which keeps popping certain questions in periodical timings so as to make sure if the student is attentive during the class or not. If they are attentive then they will answer the right questions and get the attendance of that session. If not, they will miss their attendance. 

## Sprint-1: Explored Electron Application
<li> Devil’s eye is a desktop application. We have decided to design it in an electron app using Javascript . As I have little knowledge in react and javascript in order to design better I learned certain Javascript concepts which are useful to the project. 
<li>As I started working on the project it has become tougher than it looked. I have faced the biggest challenge to integrate changes done in Java script to reflect in the main process where the electron apps can work.
<li>Inorder to get more understanding and grip on the project,  I have referenced electron documentation and watched some youtube videos and had a firm knowledge on IPC main and renderer process and successfully the hello-world page is designed in electron.

## Sprint-2: Sign In process
